CSCI6461: Computer System Architecture Project

In this project, we design and implement a simple computer simulator. This project has 4 components. And, these components will be implemented during the semester.

Component 1: Basic Machine
We are working on designing and implementing the basic machine architecture in this phase. In particular:
- Implementing a simple memory.
- Executing LOAD and STORE instructions.
- Building initial user interface to simulator

# CSCI6461-computer-architecture

CSCI6461: Computer System Architecture Project

Spring 2017

The George Washington University

In this project, we design and implement a simple computer simulator. This project has 4 components. And, these components will be implemented during the semester.

## Component 1: Basic Machine (2/11/2017)

We are working on designing and implementing the basic machine architecture in this phase. In particular:
- Implementing a simple memory.
- Executing LOAD and STORE instructions.
- Building initial user interface to simulator.

## Component 2: Memory and Cache Design (3/4/2017)
- Designing and implementing the modules for enhanced memory and cache operations.
- Implementing all instructions except for MSR, CHK, and Floating Point/Vector operations.
- Extending the user interface.
- Demonstrate 1st program running on your simulator.
